PerfAudit is a project to help make web applications faster. With every Performance Audit, we not only intend to help make a web application perform fast, but also add our findings to the pool of performance improvements that developers must add into their deployment routine to make evergreen performant applications.

The audits are brought to you by [Apoorv Saxena](https://in.linkedin.com/in/saxenaapoorv) and [Kushagra Gour](https://twitter.com/chinchang457).
