Workshop: [Performance Audit Workshop](https://in.explara.com/e/performance-audit-workshop-bangalore-2015)<br>

We will be in Bangalore from 16th July to 26th July, and are speaking at JS Channel 2015 Conference(17th - 18th July) and jQuery India 2015 Conference(22nd - 25th July). We saw this as a great opportunity, and thus are organizing Performance Audit workshop in Bangalore on 19th July. More details are listed below.

#### Overview:

Performance is a Feature, the slower your website loads and displays, the less people will use it directly impacting the growth and revenue of your business.

Yet many people are not able to understand the performance gotchas completely, and donâ€™t make it a part of their deployment process to consider the page load and rendering performance.

#### Agenda:

- Discussion of the process to decrease the start render time to under 500ms and total load time of less than 1 second.
- Comprehensive analysis and discussion of the process to achieve a pagespeed score of 100, with explanation of each point.
- Profiling with Developers Tools to explore the rendering issues and their respective remedies.
- Live Audit of Web Applications
