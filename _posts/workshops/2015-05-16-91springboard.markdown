Performance is a Feature, the slower your website loads and displays, the less people will use it directly impacting the growth and revenue of your business.

Yet many people are not able to understand the performance gotchas completely, and donâ€™t make it a part of their deployment process to consider the page load and rendering performance.

#### Agenda:

- Comprehensive analysis and discussion of the process to achieve a pagespeed score of 100, with explanation of each point.
- Profiling with Developers Tools to explore the rendering issues and their respective remedies.
- Live Audit of Web Applications
