Steps followed for DNS Lookup:

* Browser checks if the domain is in its cache.
* If not found, the browser calls gethostbyname library function (varies by OS) to do the lookup.
gethostbyname checks if the hostname can be resolved by reference in the local hosts file (whose location varies by OS) before trying to resolve the hostname through DNS.
* If gethostbyname does not have it cached nor can find it in the hosts file then it makes a request to the DNS server configured in the network stack.
