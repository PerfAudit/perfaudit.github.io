Transcoding means recompression of an image which requires conversion of image from one format to another e.g. conversion of png to jpeg because of better compression(for a particular image). The size of the image can be further reduced without reducing the quality of the image by converting the image into Webp format which allows better compression of the order of 30-35% with lossless conversion.
