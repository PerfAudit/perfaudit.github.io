Images often account for most of the downloaded bytes on a page. As a result, optimizing images can save a lot of bandwidth and improve page speed considerably. The fewer bytes the browser has to download, the less competition there is for the client's bandwidth and the faster the browser can download and render content on the screen.

**Solutions**:

* Automate the process of image optimization i.e. compression to the best format(occupies least size), learn more about it [here](/networking-performance/tools/grunt/compression/).
