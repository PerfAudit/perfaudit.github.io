Reduce round trip time by serving small images in the HTML. This can reduce the time it takes to display content to the user, especially in older browsers.

The inline gif that we use in replacement of the lazy loaded original images: `data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==`

**Issues:**

- Inlined images cannot be cached, and thus add themselves to the total size of a webpage with every use.
