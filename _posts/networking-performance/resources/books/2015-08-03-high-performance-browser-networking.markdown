High-Performance Browser Networking will be of interest to anyone interested in optimizing the delivery and performance of applications, and more generally, curious minds that are not satisfied with a simple checklist but want to know how the browser and the underlying protocols actually work under the hood. The "how" and the "why" go hand in hand: it covers the practical advice about configuration and architecture, and also explores the trade-offs and the underlying reasons for each optimization.

“Good developers know how things work. Great developers know why things work.”
