Design is the foundation of one's performance strategy: it defines the user experience and expectations, shapes development, and directly impacts operations. Designing for Performance gives one the tools to make and measure high impact performance improvements on a site, including actionable strategies to increase awareness of performance across an organization.

Great performance is good design.
