From Ilya Grigorik, Author, [High Performance Browser Networking](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/index.html){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}

A great course to head start with Web Performance. Understand how mobile and desktop browsers render pages and how HTML, CSS and JavaSript affect page load. It provides a nice overview of Google PageSpeed Insights and Chrome Developer tools.
