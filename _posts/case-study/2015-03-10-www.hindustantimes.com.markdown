Audit write up along with profiling stats:

## Network profiling

Desktop pagespeed score for HindustanTimes is just 59, which specifies a lot of scope for improvement. As Hindustan Times is a media organization, one can expect a lot of images to be a part of their content, thus maximum compression and caching of image resources should be their primary concern. They must also use progressive images to reduce the image render time.

### Image related stats:

####1,412.6 KB total in images, target size = 740.1 KB - potential savings = 672.5 KB

Minification and Compression are the redundant tasks that one must integrate in their deployment process, as they significantly contribute in increasing the page performance while decreasing the asset size and page load time of a webpage.

The first critical issue describes the reason for the increased first pixel render time, rendering is quite slow and it takes about 5.5 second to get the first glimpse of readable content, though the first pixel render time is about 3 seconds. Here's the filmstrip view for HindustanTimes.com's pageload:

To resolve the above mentioned issue, as described in the pagespeed insights, one must avoid to have render blocking JS and CSS inside <head> tag. As mentioned above in desktop optimizations, caching, compression and minification must be handled at all times, and must be made a part of the deployment process.

Other necessary optimizations possible for HindustanTimes.com:

* Make fewer HTTP requests, use concatentation of static resources
* Use mulitple domain names for parallel resource fetching
* Compress components with gzip
