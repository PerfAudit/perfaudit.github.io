#### Post Conference update:

We had a great time while interacting with the vivacious JavaScript community at JSChannel Conf. We highly applaud the efforts and initiatives of Amit, Consultant at McKinsey(Organiser of JSChannel Conference) and the entire team of JSChannel to bring forth the JSChannel Conference for the community and organise it with huge success.

We feel honored to have shared the same stage with Douglas Crockford, the creator of JavaScript, and Yehuda Katz, Ruby on Rails founder and creator of Ember.js
