#### Post Conference update:

After JSChannel conference, it was time to speak at jQuery Conference 2015. Naresh Jain, organiser of jQuery Conference, has past experience of organising several tech & management conferences before, which was reflected in the perfect execution of jQuery conference as well.

It felt great to share the same stage with jQuery board of Directors.
