#### Post Conference update:

CSS Conf Asia was phenomenal, it was a great pleasure to share the same stage with some of the tech celebrities including Chris Lilley, Father of SVG. Other speakers & audience were equally awesome, and we were glad to have a chat with them regarding Performance.

Singapore was an awesome host, and we truly enjoyed our stay while being part of DevFest Asia.
